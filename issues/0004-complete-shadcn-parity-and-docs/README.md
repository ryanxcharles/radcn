# Issue 4: Complete shadcn/ui Parity and Docs

## Goal

Complete RadCN's shadcn/ui parity for Remix 3: every shadcn component, helper,
recipe, block, and meaningful example should either exist in RadCN with
equivalent user-facing functionality or be explicitly documented as not
applicable to Remix 3 with a defensible reason.

The documentation website should become the proof surface for that parity. It
must show the completed RadCN APIs, explain Remix 3 divergences, and keep
installation copy aspirational until a later npm publishing issue makes the
package installable.

## Background

Issues 2 and 3 produced the first full RadCN component port and a polished Remix
3 documentation site. The current docs honestly mark `form`, `date-picker`, and
`data-table` as `not-shipped-yet` because they are not current `radcn/*` package
exports.

That is enough for a first docs site, but it is not enough for a completed RadCN
product. The project now needs a parity pass against the vendored shadcn/ui
source so missing surfaces are implemented deliberately instead of remaining
implicit gaps.

Primary local references:

- `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/ui/` — shadcn/ui v4 component
  source of truth for the New York style.
- `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/blocks/` — shadcn blocks that
  may map to RadCN blocks, recipes, or docs-only examples.
- `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/charts/` — chart examples and
  variants that may exceed the current RadCN `chart` primitive.
- `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry.json` and registry index files — metadata
  for the upstream registry surface.
- `radcn/packages/radcn/` — current RadCN package exports and implementation.
- `radcn/apps/docs/` — current RadCN docs site and component registry.
- `issues/0002-implement-entire-shadcn-port/` — prior implementation evidence
  and divergence records.
- `issues/0003-build-radcn-documentation-site/` — docs architecture,
  installation-scope decisions, and final docs-site verification.

Vendor checkouts are references only. Do not make RadCN code depend on
`vendor/`, and do not commit vendored source.

## Scope

This issue includes:

- auditing the complete current vendored shadcn/ui v4 registry surface;
- comparing shadcn components, helpers, blocks, recipes, and examples against
  RadCN package exports and docs pages;
- implementing missing RadCN package APIs where a reusable package surface makes
  sense for Remix 3;
- implementing recipe/block documentation where a package export does not make
  sense;
- completing the currently missing `form`, `date-picker`, and `data-table`
  outcomes;
- expanding examples and tests so RadCN behavior is visually equivalent and
  modifiable in the same way as shadcn/ui where that comparison makes sense;
- updating the docs site so completed APIs no longer appear as
  `not-shipped-yet`;
- recording all intentional divergences from shadcn/ui in the issue learnings
  and docs pages.

This issue does not include:

- publishing RadCN to npm;
- making external `pnpm add radcn` installation work;
- replacing Remix 3 web-first APIs with React-only shadcn implementation
  details;
- treating DOM equivalence as required when visual behavior, accessibility, and
  author-facing customization are equivalent.

## Analysis

Parity means user-facing capability, not mechanical React translation.

For each upstream shadcn surface, experiments should decide:

- **Package component:** reusable and appropriate as `radcn/<slug>`.
- **Helper:** package utility or event API, such as toast helpers.
- **Recipe:** documented composition of RadCN primitives, not necessarily a new
  package export.
- **Block:** larger application pattern that belongs in docs and examples, and
  may later become copyable/generated code.
- **Not applicable:** intentionally omitted because the shadcn behavior depends
  on React-only semantics or a product assumption that does not fit Remix 3.

The first experiment should not start by implementing components. It should
produce a parity inventory generated from the vendored shadcn registry and the
current RadCN export map, then identify the first coherent implementation
cluster. Later experiments should implement one coherent cluster at a time and
record discoveries needed by later clusters in `## Learnings`.

The docs website remains the public verification surface. When a component or
block becomes complete, its docs page should render a real RadCN example,
include representative source, describe installation/import intent, and explain
accessibility, customization, and Remix 3 divergence details.

Installation instructions must stay aspirational while RadCN is private and not
published to npm. Docs may show the intended future command, but they must not
claim external users can install the package today.

## Completion Criteria

This issue is complete when:

- the vendored shadcn/ui v4 registry has been audited and mapped to RadCN
  outcomes;
- every shadcn component/helper/recipe/block has a RadCN outcome: shipped
  package API, docs recipe/block, or documented not-applicable divergence;
- `form`, `date-picker`, and `data-table` are no longer unexplained gaps;
- all implemented RadCN package surfaces have package exports, TypeScript
  coverage, docs pages, live docs examples, and Playwright coverage where
  rendered behavior matters;
- docs clearly identify recipes/blocks that are not package imports;
- docs installation copy remains aspirational and says RadCN is not published to
  npm yet;
- no RadCN package or app code depends on `vendor/`;
- verification includes package typecheck, docs typecheck, docs Playwright
  coverage, relevant fixture/artifact coverage, vendor cleanliness checks, and
  no-publish/no-vendor scope checks;
- the issue is reviewed through the issue/experiment workflow and closed with a
  conclusion.

## Learnings

Record cross-component discoveries here as experiments complete.

- Experiment 1 generated `parity-inventory.md` from local source files. At the
  time, the vendored shadcn/ui v4 New York registry had 57 UI items, 244
  examples, 27 blocks, and 70 chart examples, while RadCN had 57 public package
  subpaths and 60 docs routes.
- `form` is the only upstream shadcn `ui/` item that is not a current RadCN
  package export. It is documented today as a docs-only gap.
- `date-picker` and `data-table` are not upstream `ui/` package components in
  the v4 registry; they appear as examples/block outcomes and remain RadCN
  docs-only gaps.
- `typography` is a RadCN package export without an upstream `ui/` counterpart,
  but the upstream registry has typography examples. Treat it as a recipe/API
  parity surface, not a missing upstream component.
- The first recommended implementation cluster is form parity and Remix 3 form
  recipes, because form is the only missing upstream UI package API and later
  date-picker/data-table/block work depends on a stable form story.
- Experiment 2 shipped `radcn/form` as an explicit Remix-native form API:
  `Form`, `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`,
  `FormDescription`, `FormMessage`, `formFieldIds`, and
  `formControlAttributes`.
- shadcn/ui form's React Hook Form, React context, `Controller`, `Slot`, and
  `useFormState` mechanics are intentionally not portable to RadCN. RadCN form
  parity is native markup, deterministic IDs, explicit ARIA wiring, server/action
  error display, invalid styling, and app-owned validation state.
- Later `date-picker`, `data-table`, block, and example work should reuse the
  explicit form wiring pattern when composed controls need labels,
  descriptions, invalid messages, and server/action error state.
- The candidate fixture app needs the same root pnpm virtual-store asset
  allowlist as the docs app after the top-level workspace move. Without it,
  browser enhancement imports for `remix/ui` fail before component behavior
  tests run.
- After Experiment 2, the regenerated inventory reports 58 RadCN public package
  subpaths and no missing upstream UI package APIs. The remaining docs-only
  outcomes are `date-picker` and `data-table`.
- Experiment 3 shipped `radcn/date-picker` as a package-backed composition for
  the three upstream shadcn date-picker example families: single date, presets,
  and range.
- Date-picker values use the existing calendar ISO convention:
  `YYYY-MM-DD` for single values and `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD` for ranges. This
  keeps native form submission, server validation, and docs snippets independent
  of third-party date formatting or calendar state packages.
- `enhanceDatePicker` coordinates trigger labels, hidden inputs, preset selects,
  form reset, and range completion with `enhanceCalendar` and `enhancePopover`.
  Range pickers stay open after the first selected date and close after the range
  is complete.
- After Experiment 3, the regenerated inventory reports 59 RadCN public package
  subpaths. The only remaining docs-only outcome is `data-table`.
- Experiment 4 shipped `radcn/data-table` as a package-backed composition layer
  over existing RadCN primitives. It intentionally does not port TanStack Table,
  React state, drag-and-drop libraries, chart libraries, schema validation, or
  toast dependencies.
- Data Table parity maps upstream filtering, sorting, row selection,
  pagination, column controls, row actions, responsive detail, empty state, and
  row-editing patterns to native forms, links, checkboxes, buttons, explicit
  props, and package-owned slots. Apps remain responsible for route/query state,
  data operations, persistence, and dashboard-specific behavior.
- After Experiment 4, the regenerated inventory reports 60 RadCN public package
  subpaths and no known docs-only outcomes. `data-table`, `date-picker`, and
  `typography` are RadCN package exports without upstream `ui/` counterparts,
  but each now has a documented parity decision.
- The next recommended cluster from the inventory is example parity depth,
  beginning with upstream form examples.
