# Experiment 49: Audit native-select example parity

## Description

The regenerated Issue 4 parity inventory now recommends example parity for
`native-select`. Upstream shadcn/ui New York v4 has four Native Select examples
in the current inferred cluster:

- `native-select-demo`
- `native-select-disabled`
- `native-select-groups`
- `native-select-invalid`

Current RadCN already ships `radcn/native-select`, docs coverage, candidate
fixture routes, reference React Router fixture routes, and Playwright coverage
for native select rendering, option and optgroup semantics, disabled and
invalid states, sizes, native form submission/reset, required validation, and
custom tokens. This experiment audits whether that evidence fully covers the
four upstream examples before implementation. It should separate Native
Select-owned behavior from surrounding Field/Form composition, browser-native
popup rendering, icon choice, Tailwind utilities, React prop spelling, and
vendor source.

This is an audit-only experiment. It must not change RadCN package APIs, docs
pages, fixture routes, tests, generated parity state, or resolved-cluster state.

## Changes

- Create
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/native-select-example-inventory.md`.
  - List all four upstream Native Select example ids: `native-select-demo`,
    `native-select-disabled`, `native-select-groups`, and
    `native-select-invalid`.
  - For each example, record user-facing behavior, upstream mechanics, current
    RadCN evidence, outcome, and follow-up.
  - Use outcomes `Covered`, `Partial`, `Missing`, or
    `Intentional divergence`.
  - Explicitly record whether RadCN already supports wrapper and select
    styling hooks, default and small sizes, native `<option>` and `<optgroup>`
    children, placeholder-like empty option rows, disabled state, invalid ARIA
    state, native value selection, native form submission/reset, required
    validation, custom hooks/classes/tokens, icon decoration, docs evidence,
    candidate fixture evidence, reference fixture evidence, and Playwright
    evidence.
  - Record mapping decisions for shadcn React props, `size`, `className`,
    `data-slot`, `aria-invalid`, `disabled`, native select browser behavior,
    `lucide-react` `ChevronDownIcon`, Tailwind utilities, option/optgroup
    Canvas colors, vendor source, and RadCN package/docs/fixture/test evidence.
- Inspect upstream references:
  - `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/parity-inventory.md`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/ui/native-select.tsx`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples/native-select-demo.tsx`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples/native-select-disabled.tsx`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples/native-select-groups.tsx`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples/native-select-invalid.tsx`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/public/r/styles/new-york-v4/native-select-demo.json`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/public/r/styles/new-york-v4/native-select-disabled.json`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/public/r/styles/new-york-v4/native-select-groups.json`
  - `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/public/r/styles/new-york-v4/native-select-invalid.json`
  - note adjacent but out-of-cluster `native-select-rtl` and
    `native-select-example` references without adding rows unless the active
    inventory reclassifies them.
- Inspect current RadCN evidence:
  - `radcn/packages/radcn/src/components/native-select.tsx`
  - `radcn/packages/radcn/src/styles/index.ts`
  - `radcn/apps/docs/app/content/components.tsx`
  - `radcn/apps/docs/tests/coverage.spec.ts`
  - `radcn/fixtures/scenarios/index.ts`
  - `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/app/fixtures/native-select.tsx`
  - `radcn/fixtures/reference-react-router/app/fixtures/native-select.tsx`
  - `radcn/fixtures/tests/native-select.spec.ts`
  - relevant Field/Form evidence only where it affects adjacent validation and
    submission scenarios.
- Update Issue 4 `README.md` learnings with the audit result and the next
  recommended experiment.
- Do not change `radcn/packages/radcn`, docs app source, fixture app source,
  tests, `resolved-clusters.json`, or generated `parity-inventory.md` in this
  experiment except for issue documentation.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- `native-select-example-inventory.md` exists and contains exactly one table
  row for each upstream Native Select example id.
- A deterministic Node check proves all four upstream Native Select example ids
  appear exactly once and no extra example rows exist:
  ```text
  node - <<'NODE'
  const fs = require('fs')
  const file = 'issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/native-select-example-inventory.md'
  const text = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8')
  const examples = text.match(/## Examples[\s\S]*?(?=\n## |$)/)?.[0] ?? ''
  const ids = [
    'native-select-demo',
    'native-select-disabled',
    'native-select-groups',
    'native-select-invalid',
  ]
  const rows = [...examples.matchAll(/^\| `([^`]+)` \|/gm)].map((match) => match[1])
  let failed = rows.length !== ids.length
  if (rows.length !== ids.length) {
    console.log(`row-count: ${rows.length}`)
  }
  for (const id of ids) {
    const pattern = new RegExp('\\| `'+id+'` \\|', 'g')
    const count = (examples.match(pattern) || []).length
    console.log(`${id}: ${count}`)
    if (count !== 1) failed = true
  }
  for (const row of rows) {
    if (!ids.includes(row)) {
      console.log(`unexpected: ${row}`)
      failed = true
    }
  }
  if (failed) process.exit(1)
  NODE
  ```
- The inventory distinguishes current evidence from follow-up work and does
  not mark `native-select` resolved unless every upstream Native Select example
  is `Covered` or `Intentional divergence`.
- The inventory explicitly addresses:
  - wrapper/select styling hooks, default and small sizes, native option and
    optgroup semantics, placeholder-like empty options, disabled state,
    invalid ARIA state, native value selection, native form submission/reset,
    required validation, custom hooks/classes/tokens, icon decoration, and
    docs/fixture/Playwright evidence;
  - React prop spelling and state mechanics mapping to Remix/web-first explicit
    props, native form state, route/server state, or browser-native select
    behavior;
  - `size`, `className`, `data-slot`, `aria-invalid`, `disabled`,
    `lucide-react`, Tailwind, option/optgroup Canvas colors, and vendor source
    as mappings or non-dependencies rather than mandatory RadCN dependencies.
- `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/README.md` records the audit
  conclusion and the next recommended experiment.
- `rg -n "native-select-example-inventory" issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/README.md`
  finds the new learning.
- `git diff --check`
- `git status --short` shows only expected issue documentation changes before
  the plan/result commits.
- `for d in vendor/shadcn-ui vendor/remix vendor/react-router; do git -C "$d" status --short; done`
  prints no output.

Failure criteria:

- The audit omits any upstream Native Select example id from the active parity
  inventory.
- The audit treats React, `lucide-react`, Tailwind, upstream browser popup
  styling, or vendor source as mandatory RadCN Native Select dependencies.
- The audit marks `native-select` resolved without package/docs/fixture/test
  evidence for all four upstream Native Select examples.
- The audit conflates Native Select-owned behavior with app-owned Field/Form
  labels, validation copy, submission result display, custom-class styling
  decisions, or browser-native option popup rendering differences.
- The experiment changes package, docs app, fixture, test, resolved-cluster, or
  generated parity source instead of staying an audit.

## Design Review

Reviewer: Raman the 2nd (`019e9bf5-3234-7e82-951a-ecfc23b1c855`) with
fresh context (`fork_context: false`).

Initial findings:

- **Blocker:** The experiment file had `Description`, `Changes`, and
  `Verification`, but no `## Design Review` section. AGENTS requires the
  design review result to be recorded before implementation and before the
  plan commit.

Fixes:

- Added this `## Design Review` section recording the reviewer identity,
  fresh-context status, finding, fix, and approval state.

Re-review findings:

- Prior blocker resolved. The reviewer confirmed this section now records the
  reviewer identity, fresh-context status, original blocker, fix, and approval
  state.
- No new blockers were introduced by the fix.

Approval: Approved for plan commit.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Created `native-select-example-inventory.md` and audited all four active
upstream Native Select examples:

- `native-select-demo`
- `native-select-disabled`
- `native-select-groups`
- `native-select-invalid`

The audit found strong RadCN primitive coverage for Native Select behavior:
real `<select>`, `<option>`, and `<optgroup>` elements, wrapper/select/option
data hooks, default and small sizes, disabled state, invalid ARIA state,
native value selection, native form submission/reset, required constraint
validation, custom CSS variables, option/optgroup Canvas colors, docs route
coverage, reference fixture coverage, candidate fixture coverage, and
Playwright coverage.

The example cluster remains partially covered because the docs, candidate
fixtures, and Playwright tests do not yet prove the four named upstream example
ids with complete upstream option sets as user-facing compositions. No current
evidence requires changing the `radcn/native-select` package API.

Verification run:

```text
node - <<'NODE'
const fs = require('fs')
const file = 'issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/native-select-example-inventory.md'
const text = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8')
const examples = text.match(/## Examples[\s\S]*?(?=\n## |$)/)?.[0] ?? ''
const ids = [
  'native-select-demo',
  'native-select-disabled',
  'native-select-groups',
  'native-select-invalid',
]
const rows = [...examples.matchAll(/^\| `([^`]+)` \|/gm)].map((match) => match[1])
let failed = rows.length !== ids.length
if (rows.length !== ids.length) {
  console.log(`row-count: ${rows.length}`)
}
for (const id of ids) {
  const pattern = new RegExp('\\| `'+id+'` \\|', 'g')
  const count = (examples.match(pattern) || []).length
  console.log(`${id}: ${count}`)
  if (count !== 1) failed = true
}
for (const row of rows) {
  if (!ids.includes(row)) {
    console.log(`unexpected: ${row}`)
    failed = true
  }
}
if (failed) process.exit(1)
NODE
native-select-demo: 1
native-select-disabled: 1
native-select-groups: 1
native-select-invalid: 1

rg -n "native-select-example-inventory" issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/README.md
716:  `native-select-example-inventory.md`. RadCN already has strong package,

git diff --check

git status --short
 M issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/49-audit-native-select-example-parity.md
 M issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/README.md

for d in vendor/shadcn-ui vendor/remix vendor/react-router; do git -C "$d" status --short; done
```

## Conclusion

The next experiment should implement Native Select example parity depth for
`native-select-demo`, `native-select-disabled`, `native-select-groups`, and
`native-select-invalid`. It should add named docs/fixture/test evidence and
complete upstream option sets while preserving the existing dependency-free
Native Select package API unless implementation reveals a concrete blocker.

## Completion Review

Reviewer: Dewey the 2nd (`019e9bfa-0008-7680-b11f-149e4f5ef8d4`) with fresh
context (`fork_context: false`).

Findings: none.

Approval: Approved for result commit. The reviewer confirmed that the
implementation matches the approved audit-only scope, the experiment has
`## Result` and `## Conclusion`, the README learning and `Pass` status match
the result, the inventory has exactly the four active Native Select example
rows and keeps the cluster unresolved/partial, `parity-inventory.md` supports
the audited cluster, verification commands were reproduced, vendor status was
clean, and HEAD was still the plan commit before this result commit.
