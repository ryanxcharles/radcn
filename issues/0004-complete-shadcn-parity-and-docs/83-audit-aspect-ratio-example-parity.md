# Experiment 83: Audit aspect-ratio example parity

## Description

The regenerated parity inventory after Experiment 82 recommends Aspect Ratio
as the next unresolved example cluster. Upstream shadcn/ui New York v4 has one
Aspect Ratio example, `aspect-ratio-demo`, plus the upstream Aspect Ratio UI
implementation. RadCN already exports `radcn/aspect-ratio`, has candidate
fixtures for default 16:9 and custom 1:1 ratios, and has Playwright coverage
that proves requested layout ratios.

This experiment should audit the upstream Aspect Ratio example against current
RadCN evidence and produce a focused inventory that determines whether the
cluster is already covered or which exact named-example gaps remain. It should
not implement the named example yet.

The likely remaining gap is named docs/fixture/test evidence for the exact
upstream `aspect-ratio-demo` composition:

- `AspectRatio` root with `ratio={16 / 9}`;
- `className="rounded-lg bg-muted"` on the root;
- a full-cover image using
  `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588345921523-c2dcdb7f1dcd?w=800&dpr=2&q=80`;
- image alt text `Photo by Drew Beamer`;
- image presentation equivalent to `fill`, `h-full`, `w-full`, `rounded-lg`,
  `object-cover`, `dark:brightness-[0.2]`, and `dark:grayscale`;
- upstream React client marker, Radix AspectRatio primitive, Next Image,
  `data-slot`, `className`, Tailwind rounded/background/sizing/object-fit
  utilities, dark-mode utilities, remote image mechanics, and vendor source
  mapped to RadCN's dependency-free CSS aspect-ratio wrapper, public hooks,
  `class`, `style`, CSS variables, app-owned image markup, and docs/fixture
  composition.

## Changes

- Add
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/aspect-ratio-example-inventory.md`.
  - List upstream aspect-ratio example rows found under
    `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples/aspect-ratio*.tsx`.
  - Summarize the upstream UI implementation from
    `vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx`.
  - Compare upstream behavior and mechanics with current RadCN package, docs,
    fixture, and Playwright evidence.
  - Mark `aspect-ratio-demo` as `Covered`, `Partial`, `Missing`, or
    `Intentional divergence`.
  - If partial, record the exact follow-up requirements for the next
    implementation experiment.
  - Record decisions for ratio representation, layout sizing, overflow,
    border radius, muted background, image alt text, object-cover behavior,
    full-cover image sizing, dark-mode image filters, Next Image non-dependency,
    Radix non-dependency, React non-dependency, `data-slot`, `className`,
    Tailwind utility mapping, remote image handling, public hooks, docs assets,
    fixture image strategy, and vendor source.
- Update Issue 4 `README.md`.
  - Add Experiment 83 to the experiments index as `Designed`.
  - Do not add final learnings until the experiment result is recorded.

No package, docs app, fixture, test, inventory-regeneration, or
`resolved-clusters.json` changes should be made in this audit experiment unless
the audit itself exposes an already-covered result that can be proven entirely
from existing evidence. If that happens, record the evidence and keep the
change limited to issue documentation.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- `aspect-ratio-example-inventory.md` exists and has:
  - `# Aspect Ratio Example Inventory`;
  - `## Summary`;
  - `## Examples`;
  - a table with exactly one upstream row, `aspect-ratio-demo`, using this
    header:
    `Upstream example | User-facing behavior and upstream mechanics | Current RadCN evidence | Outcome | Follow-up`;
  - `## Decisions`.
- A deterministic check proves the upstream vendor example count is exactly
  one and the inventory table contains exactly one matching row:

  ```text
  node - <<'NODE'
  const fs = require('fs')
  const vendor = fs.readdirSync('vendor/shadcn-ui/apps/v4/registry/new-york-v4/examples')
    .filter((file) => /^aspect-ratio.*\.tsx$/.test(file))
    .map((file) => file.replace(/\.tsx$/, ''))
    .sort()
  const text = fs.readFileSync('issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/aspect-ratio-example-inventory.md', 'utf8')
  const examples = text.match(/## Examples[\s\S]*?(?=\n## |$)/)?.[0] ?? ''
  const rows = [...examples.matchAll(/^\| `([^`]+)` \|[^\n]+/gm)].map((match) => match[1]).sort()
  console.log(`vendor: ${vendor.join(', ')}`)
  console.log(`inventory: ${rows.join(', ')}`)
  if (vendor.length !== 1 || vendor[0] !== 'aspect-ratio-demo') process.exit(1)
  if (rows.length !== 1 || rows[0] !== 'aspect-ratio-demo') process.exit(1)
  NODE
  ```
- A deterministic check proves the row outcome is one of `Covered`, `Partial`,
  `Missing`, or `Intentional divergence` and that any non-covered row has a
  non-empty follow-up:

  ```text
  node - <<'NODE'
  const fs = require('fs')
  const text = fs.readFileSync('issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/aspect-ratio-example-inventory.md', 'utf8')
  const row = text.match(/^\| `aspect-ratio-demo` \|([^\n]+)$/m)?.[0]
  if (!row) process.exit(1)
  const cells = row.split('|').map((cell) => cell.trim())
  const outcome = cells[4]
  const followUp = cells[5]
  console.log(`outcome: ${outcome}`)
  console.log(`follow-up: ${followUp}`)
  if (!['Covered', 'Partial', 'Missing', 'Intentional divergence'].includes(outcome)) process.exit(1)
  if (outcome !== 'Covered' && (!followUp || followUp === 'No follow-up.')) process.exit(1)
  NODE
  ```
- The audit explicitly mentions and classifies these upstream mechanics:
  React client component marker, Radix AspectRatio primitive, Next Image,
  `data-slot`, `className`, `ratio={16 / 9}`, rounded/muted root classes,
  full-cover image sizing, `object-cover`, dark-mode brightness/grayscale
  filters, exact remote image URL, exact alt text, and vendor source.
- The audit explicitly compares current RadCN evidence from:
  - `radcn/packages/radcn/src/components/aspect-ratio.tsx`;
  - `radcn/packages/radcn/src/styles/tokens.css`;
  - `radcn/apps/docs/app/content/components.tsx`;
  - `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/app/fixtures/static-display.tsx`;
  - `radcn/fixtures/tests/static-display.spec.ts`;
  - `radcn/apps/docs/tests/coverage.spec.ts`.
- The Issue 4 README `## Learnings` section records the aspect-ratio audit
  result and the next recommended experiment after the audit result is known.
  A deterministic check finds both the experiment and inventory references:

  ```text
  rg -n "Experiment 83|aspect-ratio-example-inventory" issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/README.md
  ```
- `git diff --check`
- `git status --short` shows only the new experiment file,
  `aspect-ratio-example-inventory.md`, and the Issue 4 README before the result
  commit.
- `for d in vendor/shadcn-ui vendor/remix vendor/react-router; do git -C "$d" status --short; done`
  prints no output.

Failure criteria:

- The audit omits the exact upstream image URL or alt text.
- The audit marks `aspect-ratio-demo` covered without docs, fixture, and
  Playwright evidence for the named image example, unless it records a precise
  intentional divergence with enough existing evidence.
- The audit changes package, docs app, fixture, or Playwright implementation
  files before the follow-up implementation experiment is designed and
  approved.
- The audit mutates vendor source or adds forbidden dependencies such as React,
  Radix, Next, Tailwind, lucide-react, or class-variance-authority.

## Design Review

Reviewer: Curie the 2nd (`019e9d62-22e8-7b91-bf46-7cfa48eb1672`),
fresh-context Codex subagent (`fork_context: false`).

Findings:

- Blocker: none.
- Major: none.
- Minor: clarified the required `## Examples` inventory table header so the
  deterministic row parser has an explicit schema.
- Minor: added this `## Design Review` section before the plan commit.

Approval: approved. The reviewer confirmed the Issue 4 README links
Experiment 83 as `Designed`, implementation has not started, vendor status is
clean, the scope is narrow enough for one audit experiment, and no blockers
remain.
