# Experiment 70: Implement scroll-area example parity depth

## Description

Experiment 69 audited the two active upstream Scroll Area examples and found
the cluster is partial because RadCN has generic Scroll Area package/fixture
proof but no named evidence for:

- `scroll-area-demo`
- `scroll-area-horizontal-demo`

This experiment should resolve the Scroll Area example cluster by adding named
docs, candidate fixture routes, and Playwright coverage for both examples. The
audit did not identify a required package API change: RadCN already owns native
scroll-container behavior, while repeated tag content, Separator composition,
artwork/image markup, figure/figcaption semantics, horizontal strip layout,
React fragments, Next Image, remote image loading, and Tailwind utility
classes remain separate package/app surfaces.

RadCN should not add React, Radix ScrollArea primitives, `next/image`,
Tailwind, `cn`, image optimization, remote-image loading, vendor dependencies,
or package-owned image assets for Scroll Area parity. DOM equivalence is not
required; the examples need equivalent user-facing behavior, accessibility,
visual modifiability, and author-facing customization.

## Changes

- Update `radcn/apps/docs/app/content/components.tsx`.
  - Promote Scroll Area from the generic registry preview to an authored rich
    docs page if needed by the existing docs architecture.
  - Render stable docs hooks for both upstream Scroll Area example ids using
    `data-radcn-docs-scroll-area-family`.
  - Demonstrate `scroll-area-demo` with:
    - Scroll Area dimensions equivalent to `h-72 w-48`;
    - rounded bordered surface;
    - viewport content padding equivalent to `p-4`;
    - heading `Tags`;
    - exactly 50 tag rows from `v1.2.0-beta.50` down to
      `v1.2.0-beta.1`;
    - Separator composition between rows using `radcn/separator`;
    - vertical scrollbar/thumb evidence;
    - vertical native scroll evidence through docs hooks and Playwright.
  - Demonstrate `scroll-area-horizontal-demo` with:
    - Scroll Area width equivalent to `w-96`;
    - rounded bordered `whitespace-nowrap`-style surface;
    - horizontal `w-max` strip layout with spacing and padding;
    - three figure items for Ornella Binni, Tom Byrom, and Vladimir
      Malyavko;
    - image semantics with accessible `alt="Photo by {artist}"`, `width=300`,
      `height=400`, and 3:4 aspect evidence;
    - figcaption text `Photo by {artist}` with emphasized artist text;
    - explicit horizontal `ScrollBar orientation="horizontal"` and thumb;
    - horizontal native scroll evidence through docs hooks and Playwright.
  - Use deterministic artwork placeholders or inline/local assets that do not
    require network image loading, while documenting the mapping from upstream
    remote Unsplash `next/image` usage.
  - Include mapping copy for React props, Radix `ScrollAreaPrimitive`,
    `className`, `data-slot`, Tailwind utilities, `cn`, default vertical
    scrollbar behavior, explicit horizontal `ScrollBar`, Separator
    composition, repeated tag generation, React fragments/keys, `next/image`,
    remote image URLs, image optimization, image dimensions, figure/figcaption
    markup, horizontal strip layout, and vendor source.
- Update candidate fixtures:
  - `radcn/fixtures/scenarios/index.ts`
  - `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/app/fixtures/scroll-area.tsx`
  Add named Scroll Area fixture routes for `demo` and `horizontal-demo`,
  preserving existing generic Scroll Area routes.
- Update fixture Playwright coverage in
  `radcn/fixtures/tests/avatar-scroll-area.spec.ts`.
  - Verify `scroll-area/demo` exposes public Scroll Area hooks, exact heading,
    50 tag rows, first/last tag text, Separator composition, vertical
    scrollbar/thumb, focusability, native vertical scrolling, and sizing/layout
    evidence.
  - Verify `scroll-area/horizontal-demo` exposes public Scroll Area hooks,
    three figure items, artist names, image alt text, width/height/aspect
    evidence, figcaption text, horizontal strip layout evidence, explicit
    horizontal scrollbar/thumb/corner evidence, focusability, and native
    horizontal scrolling.
  - Keep existing generic Scroll Area behavior tests passing.
- Update docs Playwright coverage in
  `radcn/apps/docs/tests/coverage.spec.ts`.
  - Assert stable docs hooks for `scroll-area-demo` and
    `scroll-area-horizontal-demo`.
  - Assert rendered Scroll Area, viewport, scrollbar, thumb, Separator, tag,
    figure, image, figcaption, and layout evidence.
  - Assert the required mapping copy without requiring DOM equivalence with
    shadcn/ui.
- Update
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/scroll-area-example-inventory.md`.
  - Change `scroll-area-demo` to `Covered` only after docs, fixture, and
    Playwright evidence exists.
  - Change `scroll-area-horizontal-demo` to `Covered` only after docs, fixture,
    and Playwright evidence exists.
  - Record final decisions for Separator composition, repeated tag generation,
    deterministic artwork placeholders or assets, image alt/dimension/aspect
    evidence, figure/figcaption semantics, horizontal strip layout, public
    hooks, custom layout evidence, and upstream non-dependencies.
- Update
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/resolved-clusters.json`.
  - Add `scroll-area` as a resolved example cluster only after both example
    rows are `Covered` or intentionally diverged with evidence.
- Regenerate
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/parity-inventory.md` with
  `node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs`.
- Update Issue 4 `README.md` learnings with the final Scroll Area example
  outcome and the next generated recommendation.
- Do not change `radcn/packages/radcn` unless implementation discovers a real
  package-level gap that is necessary for the two named examples. If such a
  gap appears, record it in the result before changing package code.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- Package, docs, and fixture typechecks pass:
  ```text
  pnpm radcn:typecheck
  pnpm --dir radcn/apps/docs typecheck
  pnpm fixtures:candidate:typecheck
  ```
- Fixture Scroll Area coverage passes:
  ```text
  pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/fixtures/playwright.config.ts avatar-scroll-area.spec.ts
  ```
- Docs Playwright coverage passes:
  ```text
  pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/apps/docs/playwright.config.ts coverage.spec.ts
  ```
- A deterministic Node check proves both upstream Scroll Area example ids
  appear exactly once in `scroll-area-example-inventory.md`, and both are
  `Covered` or an explicitly recorded intentional divergence:
  ```text
  node - <<'NODE'
  const fs = require('fs')
  const file = 'issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/scroll-area-example-inventory.md'
  const text = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8')
  const examples = text.match(/## Examples[\s\S]*?(?=\n## |$)/)?.[0] ?? ''
  const expected = ['scroll-area-demo', 'scroll-area-horizontal-demo']
  const rows = [...examples.matchAll(/^\| `([^`]+)` \|[^\n]+/gm)]
  let failed = rows.length !== expected.length
  for (const id of expected) {
    const row = rows.filter((match) => match[1] === id)
    console.log(`${id}: ${row.length} ${row[0]?.[0] ?? ''}`)
    if (
      row.length !== 1 ||
      (!row[0][0].includes('| Covered |') &&
        !row[0][0].includes('| Intentional divergence |'))
    ) {
      failed = true
    }
  }
  for (const row of rows) {
    if (!expected.includes(row[1])) {
      console.log(`unexpected: ${row[1]}`)
      failed = true
    }
  }
  if (failed) process.exit(1)
  NODE
  ```
- A deterministic Node check proves `resolved-clusters.json` includes an
  `examples` entry with `slug = "scroll-area"`, `status = "resolved"`, and
  evidence for Experiment 69, Experiment 70, and
  `scroll-area-example-inventory.md`.
- `node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs` regenerates
  `parity-inventory.md`; a deterministic check proves:
  - `scroll-area` is absent from `## Unresolved Example Clusters`;
  - `## First Recommended Cluster` no longer says
    `Example parity for scroll-area`.
- Fixture tests assert:
  - named Scroll Area routes expose public RadCN hooks;
  - `scroll-area/demo` proves exact heading, 50 tag rows, first/last tag text,
    Separator composition, vertical scrollbar/thumb, sizing/layout evidence,
    focus behavior, and native vertical scrolling;
  - `scroll-area/horizontal-demo` proves the three artwork figures, artist
    names, accessible image names, width/height/aspect evidence,
    figcaption text, horizontal strip layout, explicit horizontal
    scrollbar/thumb/corner evidence, focus behavior, native horizontal
    scrolling, and that any rendered artwork `img[src]` values in the named
    route are non-network sources: local paths, `data:` URLs, or absent because
    CSS/non-loading placeholders are intentionally used;
  - existing generic Scroll Area behavior tests still pass.
- Docs coverage asserts the Scroll Area page renders stable evidence for both
  named docs examples and source/API text mentions the required mapping copy.
- Docs coverage asserts every artwork image inside
  `[data-radcn-docs-scroll-area-family="scroll-area-horizontal-demo"]` uses a
  non-network `src` value: local path, `data:` URL, or no `img` at all because
  CSS/non-loading placeholders are intentionally used.
- Both docs and fixture coverage must fail if the named horizontal Scroll Area
  examples render artwork images whose `src` starts with `http:`, `https:`, or
  contains `images.unsplash.com`.
- Dependency and scope checks pass:
  ```text
  node - <<'NODE'
  const fs = require('fs')
  const path = require('path')
  const roots = ['radcn/packages/radcn', 'radcn/apps/docs', 'radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix']

    return (
      name === 'react' ||

      name.startsWith('@tailwindcss/') ||
      name.includes('/vendor/') ||
      name.startsWith('../vendor/')
    )
  }
  const files = []
  function walk(dir) {
    for (const entry of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
      if (entry.name === 'node_modules' || entry.name === '.git') continue
      const full = path.join(dir, entry.name)
      if (entry.isDirectory()) walk(full)
      else if (/\.[cm]?[tj]sx?$/.test(entry.name)) files.push(full)
    }
  }
  for (const root of roots) walk(root)
  let failed = false
  for (const file of files) {
    const text = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8')
    for (const match of text.matchAll(/^\s*import(?:\s+type)?[\s\S]*?\sfrom\s+['"]([^'"]+)['"]/gm)) {
      if (forbiddenImport(match[1])) {
        console.log(`${file}: forbidden import ${match[1]}`)
        failed = true
      }
    }
  }
  if (failed) process.exit(1)
  NODE
  ```
- A deterministic manifest check proves no forbidden dependencies exist in the
  current RadCN manifests, and a diff check proves this experiment did not add
  forbidden lockfile dependency markers:

- `git diff --check`
- `git status --short` shows only expected implementation and issue
  documentation changes before the result commit.
- `for d in vendor/shadcn-ui vendor/remix vendor/react-router; do git -C "$d" status --short; done`
  prints no output.

Failure criteria:

- Either active upstream Scroll Area example remains `Partial` or `Missing`
  without a recorded intentional divergence.
- The implementation treats React, Radix ScrollArea primitives, `next/image`,
  image optimization, remote image loading, Tailwind, `cn`, upstream
  `data-slot`, or vendor source as mandatory RadCN Scroll Area dependencies.
- The docs or fixtures prove generic Scroll Area behavior but omit the named
  `scroll-area-demo` or `scroll-area-horizontal-demo` compositions.
- The implementation changes `radcn/scroll-area` package APIs without a
  recorded package-level need found during implementation.
- The implementation conflates Scroll Area-owned root/viewport/scrollbar
  behavior with app-owned Separator, repeated content, image,
  figure/figcaption, remote asset, or custom layout decisions.

## Design Review

Reviewer: Linnaeus the 2nd (`019e9cc6-925c-78a1-b3c9-30b58e8159a0`),
fresh-context Codex subagent (`fork_context: false`).

Findings:

- Blocker: none.
- Major: the design required deterministic artwork placeholders or local assets
  but did not include a concrete pass/fail check that rejects remote image URLs
  or Next Image usage. Fixed by adding scoped Playwright pass criteria for the
  named docs and fixture horizontal Scroll Area examples: any rendered artwork
  `img[src]` values must be local paths, `data:` URLs, or absent because
  CSS/non-loading placeholders are intentionally used, and the tests must fail
  for `http:`, `https:`, or `images.unsplash.com`.
- Minor: the experiment did not yet contain a recorded `## Design Review`
  section. This was expected before recording the review and is now addressed.

Re-review:

- The reviewer confirmed the original major finding is resolved.
- The reviewer confirmed the broad source-scan blocker introduced by the first
  fix is resolved.
- No new blocker was introduced.

Approval: approved. The reviewer confirmed the plan is coherent for one
implementation-depth experiment, the Issue 4 README links it with status
`Designed`, the plan has Description, Changes, and Verification sections,
implementation has not started before the plan commit, vendor checkouts are
clean, and scoped non-network artwork assertions are now required.

## Result

**Result:** Pass.

Experiment 70 resolved Scroll Area example parity without changing the
`radcn/scroll-area` package API.

Implemented evidence:

- `radcn/apps/docs/app/content/components.tsx` now promotes Scroll Area to a
  rich docs page with named `scroll-area-demo` and
  `scroll-area-horizontal-demo` examples, stable
  `data-radcn-docs-scroll-area-family` hooks, source snippets, accessibility
  notes, customization notes, and divergence mapping.
- `radcn/fixtures/scenarios/index.ts` and
  `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/app/fixtures/scroll-area.tsx` now include
  named `demo` and `horizontal-demo` candidate routes.
- `radcn/fixtures/tests/avatar-scroll-area.spec.ts` now proves the named Tags
  list, 50 beta rows, Separator composition, vertical native scrolling, and
  the horizontal artwork strip with figure/image/figcaption semantics,
  deterministic non-network image sources, and native horizontal scrolling.
- `radcn/apps/docs/tests/coverage.spec.ts` now proves the Scroll Area docs page
  renders both named example families, public hooks, exact copy, tag counts,
  Separator evidence, artwork semantics, non-network image sources, scroll
  behavior, and mapping copy.
- `scroll-area-example-inventory.md` marks `scroll-area-demo` and
  `scroll-area-horizontal-demo` `Covered`.
- `resolved-clusters.json` records the `scroll-area` example cluster as
  resolved with evidence for Experiments 69 and 70 plus the Scroll Area
  inventory.
- `parity-inventory.md` was regenerated and now recommends example parity for
  `select` next.

Verification passed:

```text
pnpm radcn:typecheck
pnpm --dir radcn/apps/docs typecheck
pnpm fixtures:candidate:typecheck
pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/fixtures/playwright.config.ts avatar-scroll-area.spec.ts
pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/apps/docs/playwright.config.ts coverage.spec.ts
node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs
```

Remaining required verification checks are recorded in the completion pass
below before the result commit.

## Conclusion

Scroll Area example parity is complete. RadCN already had the required
Scroll Area-owned root, viewport, scrollbar, thumb, corner, focus, token, and
native scrolling behavior. The missing work was named docs, fixture, and
Playwright proof for the two upstream compositions. Separator rows, repeated
tag generation, figure/figcaption markup, image presentation, deterministic
artwork data, and horizontal strip layout remain app-owned content inside the
Scroll Area viewport. No React, Radix, Next Image, Tailwind, `cn`,
remote-image loading, image optimization, vendor dependency, or package API
change was needed.

The regenerated parity inventory recommends auditing `select` example parity
next.

## Completion Review

Reviewer: Wegener the 2nd (`019e9cd0-d6ba-78b3-bbd1-ef237f356799`),
fresh-context Codex subagent (`fork_context: false`).

Findings:

- Blocker: none.
- Major: none.
- Minor: none.

Approval: approved. The reviewer confirmed the implementation matches the
approved scope, the result commit had not been made before review, the result
and conclusion are recorded, the Issue 4 README learning and status match the
pass result, both Scroll Area inventory rows are `Covered`,
`resolved-clusters.json` includes the Scroll Area evidence, the regenerated
parity inventory recommends `select` next, deterministic non-network artwork
is used and tested, forbidden dependency checks passed, `git diff --check`
passed, and vendor status was clean.
