# Experiment 26: Implement breadcrumb example parity depth

## Description

Experiment 25 found that Breadcrumb has the core package primitives but lacks
full example-depth coverage for the 6 upstream shadcn/ui Breadcrumb examples:
`breadcrumb-demo`, `breadcrumb-dropdown`, `breadcrumb-ellipsis`,
`breadcrumb-link`, `breadcrumb-responsive`, and `breadcrumb-separator`.

This experiment implements that depth across the RadCN package defaults, docs
site, candidate fixtures, and Playwright tests. The goal is equivalent
user-facing behavior, accessibility, visual behavior, and author-facing
modifiability, not React or DOM equivalence. React state, Next `Link`, Radix
Slot, lucide icons, Tailwind utilities, and vendor code must not become RadCN
dependencies.

## Changes

- Update `radcn/packages/radcn/src/components/breadcrumb.tsx`.
  - Align the default `BreadcrumbSeparator` visual with shadcn's chevron-style
    default using an app/package-owned glyph such as `›`.
  - Preserve author-supplied separator children so Slash-style separators remain
    possible without an icon package.
  - Keep native `nav`, `ol`, `li`, `a`, and current-page semantics.
- Update `radcn/packages/radcn/src/styles/tokens.css` and regenerate
  `radcn/packages/radcn/src/styles/index.ts` if style tokens change.
  - Add or refine public classes needed for Breadcrumb example parity:
    chevron/slash glyph sizing, label+chevron trigger spacing, ellipsis trigger
    sizing, truncation/max-width hooks, and responsive desktop/mobile branch
    visibility.
  - Keep styling modifiable through classes, inline styles, or CSS variables.
- Update `radcn/apps/docs/app/content/components.tsx`.
  - Replace the seed-only Breadcrumb docs with a rich Breadcrumb entry and live
    preview covering all six upstream example families.
  - Add source snippets that use RadCN imports, native `BreadcrumbLink href`,
    app-owned glyphs, DropdownMenu, Drawer, and Button composition.
  - Document intentional mappings: Next `Link`/`asChild` to native links or
    app-owned anchors; React `useState`/`useMediaQuery` to Remix 3 browser/CSS
    composition; lucide icons to app-owned glyphs/assets; Tailwind utilities to
    RadCN classes/styles/CSS variables.
- Update `radcn/fixtures/scenarios/index.ts` and
  `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/app/fixtures/navigation-collection.tsx`.
  - Add named Breadcrumb scenarios for all upstream ids:
    `demo`, `dropdown`, `ellipsis`, `link`, `responsive`, and `separator`.
  - Preserve existing routes `default`, `collapsed`, and `custom-separator` as
    compatibility aliases unless a test proves they are redundant.
  - Implement DropdownMenu breadcrumb branches with accessible triggers and menu
    items.
  - Implement the responsive Breadcrumb using RadCN primitives and
    fixture/docs-owned breakpoint behavior. Desktop should expose a DropdownMenu
    branch at wide viewports; mobile should expose a Drawer branch at narrow
    viewports, with Drawer title/description, link list, and outline Button
    close action.
- Update `radcn/fixtures/tests/navigation-collection.spec.ts`.
  - Add Playwright assertions for all six upstream Breadcrumb example families.
  - Verify semantics, accessible names, current page, hidden ellipsis text,
    default chevron-style separator, Slash-style custom separator, dropdown
    trigger/menu behavior, responsive desktop DropdownMenu behavior, responsive
    mobile Drawer behavior, truncation/max-width hooks, and native link hrefs.
- Update `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/breadcrumb-example-inventory.md`.
  - Change each row to `Covered` once package/docs/fixture/test evidence exists.
  - Record stable divergences for React/Next/Radix/lucide/Tailwind mechanics.
  - Add a resolution section for Breadcrumb.
- Update `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/resolved-clusters.json`.
  - Add `breadcrumb` with evidence for Experiments 25 and 26 plus the inventory
    file once all six rows are covered.
- Run `node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs` and update
  `issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/parity-inventory.md`.
- Update Issue 4 `README.md` learnings with the completed Breadcrumb outcome
  and the next recommended cluster from the regenerated inventory.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- Type checks pass:
  ```text
  pnpm radcn:typecheck
  pnpm --dir radcn/apps/docs typecheck
  pnpm fixtures:candidate:typecheck
  ```
- Breadcrumb fixture tests pass:
  ```text
  pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/fixtures/playwright.config.ts navigation-collection.spec.ts
  ```
- Docs coverage tests pass:
  ```text
  pnpm exec playwright test -c radcn/apps/docs/playwright.config.ts coverage.spec.ts
  ```
- The parity audit passes and regenerates the inventory:
  ```text
  node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs
  ```
- The parity audit is idempotent after regeneration:
  ```text
  tmp=$(mktemp) && cp issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/parity-inventory.md "$tmp" && node scripts/audit-shadcn-parity.mjs >/tmp/radcn-parity-regen.log && diff -u "$tmp" issues/0004-complete-shadcn-parity-and-docs/parity-inventory.md; regen_status=$?; rm "$tmp"; cat /tmp/radcn-parity-regen.log; exit $regen_status
  ```
- Deterministic checks prove:
  - all 6 upstream Breadcrumb example ids appear exactly once in
    `breadcrumb-example-inventory.md`;
  - all 6 Breadcrumb example rows have final outcome `Covered`;
  - `resolved-clusters.json` includes `slug = "breadcrumb"`,
    `status = "resolved"`, and evidence for Experiment 25, Experiment 26, and
    `breadcrumb-example-inventory.md`;
  - `radcn/packages/radcn/src/styles/index.ts` exactly matches
    `tokens.css` if styles changed;
  - `breadcrumb` is absent from unresolved example clusters in
    `parity-inventory.md` and the first recommended cluster has advanced;
  - docs contain labels/copy for `Demo`, `Dropdown`, `Ellipsis`, `Link`,
    `Responsive`, and `Separator`;
  - docs and fixtures contain no imports from React, Next, Radix, lucide,
    vendor paths, or npm publishing configuration.
- Playwright assertions specifically cover:
  - `breadcrumb-link`: native Home and Components links plus current page;
  - `breadcrumb-ellipsis`: collapsed ellipsis with hidden `More` text;
  - `breadcrumb-separator`: Slash-style author-supplied separators;
  - `breadcrumb-demo`: ellipsis DropdownMenu trigger with hidden `Toggle menu`
    text and menu items;
  - `breadcrumb-dropdown`: label+chevron DropdownMenu trigger and menu items;
  - `breadcrumb-responsive`: desktop DropdownMenu branch at a wide viewport and
    mobile Drawer branch, Drawer title/description, link list, and outline
    Button close action at a narrow viewport;
  - visible truncation/max-width hooks on responsive trailing items.
- Dependency-policy check passes with no matches:
  ```text
  rg -n "from ['\"]react['\"]|from ['\"][^'\"]*next/|from ['\"][^'\"]*radix-ui|from ['\"][^'\"]*@radix-ui|from ['\"][^'\"]*lucide-react|from ['\"](\\.\\./)*vendor/|from ['\"][^'\"]*vendor/|npm publish|pnpm publish|publishConfig" radcn/packages/radcn radcn/apps/docs radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix package.json
  ```
- Manifest dependency-policy check passes with no matches in RadCN package,
  docs, workspace, and candidate Remix manifests. The reference React Router
  fixture is intentionally excluded because it is the React comparison app.
  ```text
  rg -n '"(react|next|radix-ui|@radix-ui[^"]*|lucide-react|tailwindcss)"|publishConfig|npm publish|pnpm publish' package.json radcn/packages/radcn/package.json radcn/apps/docs/package.json radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/package.json
  ```
- `git diff --check`
- `for d in vendor/shadcn-ui vendor/remix vendor/react-router; do git -C "$d" status --short; done`
  prints no output.

Failure criteria:

- Any of the six upstream Breadcrumb examples remains `Partial` or `Missing`.
- The implementation adds React, Next, Radix Slot, lucide, Tailwind, vendor, or
  publishing dependencies to RadCN package/docs/fixture source.
- Responsive parity is claimed without viewport-specific Playwright evidence
  for both desktop DropdownMenu and mobile Drawer behavior.
- The default separator change breaks author-supplied separator children or
  current-page navigation semantics.
- The experiment changes unrelated component clusters or starts the next cluster
  before Breadcrumb result review and result commit.

## Design Review

Reviewer: Erdos (`019e9afd-c44b-73c1-8961-c8cf423f3272`)
Fresh context: yes (`fork_context: false`)

Findings:

- Blocker: none.
- Major: the dependency-policy verification checked source imports and the root
  `package.json`, but did not check package/app manifests where forbidden
  dependencies or publishing configuration could be added.
- Minor: the required `## Design Review` section was empty before this review
  was recorded.

Fixes:

- Added a manifest dependency-policy check for the root workspace manifest,
  `radcn/packages/radcn/package.json`, `radcn/apps/docs/package.json`, and
  `radcn/fixtures/candidate-remix/package.json`. The reference React Router
  fixture is intentionally excluded because it is the React comparison app.
- Recorded this design review before the plan commit.

Approval result: approved with no blockers. Erdos confirmed the issue README
links Experiment 26 as `Designed`, the design has the required sections, scope
is contained to Breadcrumb example parity, verification is concrete, vendor
cleanliness is checked, and implementation has not started before the plan
commit.

Re-review: Erdos confirmed the manifest coverage and design-review recording
fixes, then found that the manifest regex still missed scoped Radix packages
such as `@radix-ui/react-slot`. The regex was tightened to
`@radix-ui[^"]*` before the plan commit.

Final re-review: approved with no blockers. Erdos confirmed the tightened
manifest regex catches scoped Radix package names while still excluding the
intentional React reference fixture.
